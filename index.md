### Terms Of Service:

• MIT Hodor completely relies on the information provided by the SLCM page for all our users. If the information you require hasn’t been uploaded/ updated on the website, the Bot won’t be able to provide an apt response.

• MIT Hodor practically cannot botch anything up, so any kind of mishaps are most certainly a ludicrous action on the part of the user. We shall not be held responsible for any mishaps that occur due to the former.

• All the code behind the MIT Hodor is open source and available for open scrutiny and viewing at https://github.com/kalbhor/MIT-Hodor

• If you’re a cute girl, send us your number at 8826575775 (Lakshay Kalbhor), 8802060027 (Neel Vashisht), and 9930145707 (Ananya Kaushik). You can also contact us on this number if you face any problems that need to be solved urgently.

• MIT Hodor is in no way affiliated with any Manipal University endeavours and is a student oriented information bot designed by Lakshay Kalbhor, Neel Vashisht, and Ananya Kaushik.
